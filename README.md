# Robotic Arm Joint – 3D Printing Preparation and Material Selection

## 🧩 STL Conversion
The robotic arm joint model was exported as `.STL` under the name:

## 🛠️ Slicer Setup (AnkerMake Studio)

The STL file was imported into **AnkerMake Studio** and sliced using the following settings:

| Setting                  | Value                |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Material                 | PA (Nylon)           |
| Layer Height             | 0.2 mm               |
| Infill Density           | 50%                  |
| Wall Line Count          | 3                    |
| Supports                 | Enabled              |
| Brim                     | Enabled              |
| Print Temperature        | 255°C (Nozzle)       |
| Bed Temperature          | 95°C                 |
| Print Speed              | 40 mm/s              |

## 🧪 Chosen Printing Material: **Nylon (PA)**

### ✅ Why Nylon:
- Exceptional mechanical strength for moving parts
- High wear resistance
- Slight flexibility to avoid breakage
- Moisture and heat resistant
- Ideal for long-term robotic applications

> ⚠ Note: Nylon requires a printer that supports high-temperature extrusion and good bed adhesion (glue stick or adhesive sheet recommended).
